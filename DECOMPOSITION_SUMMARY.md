## New HomePage Structure

The new `HomePage.tsx` is now clean and modular:

```tsx
// Clean imports
import { CustomCursor, Header, Footer, HeroSection, AboutSection, ... } from '../sections';

// Simple component structure
return (
  <>
    <CustomCursor />
    <Header setShowPricing={setShowPricing} />
    <HeroSection />
    <AboutSection />
    <ServicesSection />
    {/* ... other sections */}
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```
