# Sections Architecture

This document describes the clean architecture implementation for the Magic Decor HomePage.

## Structure

The HomePage has been decomposed into the following sections:

```
src/sections/
├── data/
│   └── index.ts           # All static data (sliders, testimonials, etc.)
├── layout/
│   ├── CustomCursor.tsx   # Custom cursor component
│   ├── Preloader.tsx      # Loading screen component
│   ├── Header.tsx         # Main header with navigation
│   ├── MobileNavigation.tsx # Mobile navigation menu
│   ├── SearchPopup.tsx    # Search overlay popup
│   ├── Footer.tsx         # Site footer
│   └── index.ts           # Layout exports
├── content/
│   ├── HeroSection.tsx    # Main slider/hero section
│   ├── AboutSection.tsx   # About company section
│   ├── FeatureSection.tsx # Features showcase
│   ├── ServicesSection.tsx # Services offering
│   ├── QualityWorkSection.tsx # Quality work showcase
│   ├── ProjectsSection.tsx # Projects gallery
│   ├── TeamSection.tsx    # Team members
│   ├── TestimonialsSection.tsx # Customer testimonials
│   ├── BrandSection.tsx   # Brand partnerships
│   ├── BlogSection.tsx    # News & blog posts
│   └── index.ts           # Content exports
└── index.ts               # Main exports
```

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each section is now a separate, reusable component
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and edit specific sections
3. **Clean Code**: The main HomePage is now very clean and readable
4. **Reusability**: Sections can be reused in other pages
5. **Testing**: Each section can be tested independently
6. **Performance**: Easier to implement lazy loading for sections

## Usage

The HomePage now imports all sections and uses them as components:

```tsx
import {
  // Layout components
  CustomCursor,
  Preloader,
  Header,
  MobileNavigation,
  SearchPopup,
  Footer,
  // Content sections
  HeroSection,
  AboutSection,
  FeatureSection,
  ServicesSection,
  QualityWorkSection,
  ProjectsSection,
  TeamSection,
  TestimonialsSection,
  BrandSection,
  BlogSection,
} from '../sections';
```

## Key Features Preserved

- All original functionality is maintained
- Swiper integration for sliders
- WOW.js animations
- Custom cursor functionality
- Mobile navigation
- Pricing page integration
- All interactive elements work as before

## State Management

- `projectThumbs` state is passed to ProjectsSection for Swiper thumbs
- `showPricing` state controls the pricing page display
- All event handlers and useEffect logic preserved

This architecture makes the codebase much more maintainable while preserving all existing functionality.
